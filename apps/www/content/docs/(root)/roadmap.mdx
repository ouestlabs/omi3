description: Current state of audio ui and where we're headed next.
---

**audio ui** is part of the **Ouest Audio** project—an open-source initiative focused on building comprehensive audio processing and playback capabilities for web applications. Built on Base UI primitives, we provide not just components, but a layered system of **primitives**, **particles**, and **atoms** for building modern audio interfaces.

Our goal is to create a complete ecosystem for audio in web applications, from low-level UI primitives to high-level audio players and interactive experiences.

## Project Overview

audio ui is built from the ground up with Base UI as its foundation, providing:

- **UI primitives** built on Base UI for common interface needs
- **Particles** that combine primitives into audio-specific patterns (players, controls, visualizers, etc.)
- **Atoms** that integrate with audio engines and external services for complete audio solutions

## Current Status

- **40+ UI primitives** already available, covering common interface needs.
- A **growing set of particles** focused on audio interfaces, including audio players, controls, visualizers, and more.
- **Core audio engine** (`audio-engine`) providing robust audio playback management with Web Audio API integration.

## What's Next

- Expand the **primitives set**, ensuring full coverage of common UI needs for audio interfaces.
- Add more **audio-focused particles**, including advanced players, playlist components, waveform editors, and more.
- Introduce **atoms** that integrate with audio services, streaming APIs, and cloud storage providers.
- Enhance audio engine capabilities with advanced features like audio effects, real-time processing, and multi-track support.
