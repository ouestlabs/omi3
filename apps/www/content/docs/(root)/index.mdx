description: A modern audio UI component library built on top of Base UI. Built for developers and AI.
---

**audio ui** is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and composable components for building audio interfaces in your React apps. Built on top of [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), it's designed for you to copy, paste, and own.

We think Base UI is the best foundation for modern web applications. We've taken its powerful, unstyled primitives and given them a design system that's ready to go, right out of the box. Whether you're building audio players, media controls, or interactive sound experiences, audio ui provides the building blocks you need.

We're building it in the open for anyone who wants to create beautiful, accessible audio user interfaces.

  <AlertDescription>
    audio ui is currently in early development. We're building this library in
    the open and actively working on new components and features. Base UI itself
    is also in beta, so you may encounter breaking changes as both projects
    evolve. We recommend using this in projects where you're comfortable
    adapting to changes.

## How It Works

Our approach is simple: you should own your code. We're inspired by the copy-paste ethos of **shadcn/ui**.

Instead of installing a package, you get the source code. This means:

- **No abstractions:** You have full control over how components look and behave.
- **Endless customization:** Need to change something? Just edit the file.
- **Learn by doing:** See how components are built and adapt them to your needs.

## Like shadcn/ui, but with Base UI

If you've used shadcn/ui, you'll feel right at home. We follow the same copy-paste philosophy, but built on **Base UI** instead.

We chose Base UI for its robust, accessible, and unopinionated primitives. It handles the hard parts—like accessibility, keyboard navigation, and focus management—without imposing any styles. This gives us the freedom to create a design system that is both beautiful and flexible, optimized for building audio experiences.

## Primitives, Particles and Atoms

At the core of audio ui are the **UI primitives**—unstyled, accessible building blocks powered by Base UI. These are the foundation: low-level components that handle accessibility, focus management, and keyboard interactions, without dictating design.

On top of these primitives, we introduce [particles](/particles). Particles are **pre-assembled components**—like audio players, media controls, visualizers, and seek bars—that combine multiple primitives into ready-to-use solutions. They're a bit more opinionated in design, but still easy to customize, extend, or break apart when needed.

Finally, we go a step further with **atoms**. Atoms are **API-enhanced Particles**: components that don't just manage UI state locally, but also integrate with audio engines and external services. Think of them as smart components that connect UI to audio APIs, providing out-of-the-box behaviors for common audio patterns (playback management, waveform visualization, playlist handling, etc.).

Together, primitives, particles, and atoms give you a full spectrum:

- **Primitives** → the foundation (buttons, sliders, dialogs, etc.)
- **Particles** → the audio patterns (audio players, controls, visualizers)
- **Atoms** → the integrations (connected to audio engines and APIs)

This layered approach lets you choose the right level of abstraction for your project—whether you need a barebone primitive, a polished audio UI pattern, or a complete audio-ready solution.

## Built for Humans and AI

We're building an infrastructure for both humans and AI. Our components are written to be clear, readable, and predictable, so that language models can understand, reason about, and modify them.

## Open Source

This project is open source. We build in public, maintain transparency, and believe in the power of open collaboration.

audio ui is part of the **Ouest Audio** project an open-source initiative focused on building comprehensive audio processing and playback capabilities for web applications. We're building it in the open so that anyone can contribute, learn, and create better audio experiences on the web.

We're excited to see what you build with it, and always welcome contributions, feedback, or improvements.

## Get Involved

We're always looking for contributors. Whether it's a bug report, a new feature, or a documentation update, we appreciate your help.
