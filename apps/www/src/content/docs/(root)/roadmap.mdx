description: Current state of audio/ui and where we're headed next.
---

**audio/ui** is a modern component library for building audio interfaces in React applications. Built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), we provide accessible, composable components that you can copy, paste, and customize to fit your needs.

## Current Status

We're actively building and improving `audio/ui`. Here's what's available today:

### Components

- **Audio Player**: A fully-featured, composable audio player with queue management, shuffle, repeat modes, and volume control
- **Audio Queue**: Queue management components with search, sortable tracks, and preferences
- **Custom UI Components**: Extended components like `slider` (with buffer support) and `empty` that complement shadcn/ui's component set

### Library

- **Audio Store**: A Zustand-based state management solution for audio playback with localStorage persistence
- **Audio Utilities**: Helper functions for formatting durations and managing audio playback

### Particles

- **Pre-assembled Patterns**: Ready-to-use audio player patterns that combine multiple components

## What's Next

We're continuously working on improving and expanding `audio/ui`. Here's what we're planning:

### Components

- **More Audio Components**: Additional audio-specific UI patterns and controls
- **Enhanced Player Features**: Advanced playback controls, playlist management, and audio visualization
- **Visualization Components**: Waveform displays, spectrum analyzers, and other audio visualizations

### Documentation

- **More Examples**: Additional usage examples and patterns
- **Guides**: Best practices and advanced usage guides
- **API Reference**: Comprehensive API documentation

### Performance & Quality

- **Performance Optimizations**: Further improvements to component performance and bundle size
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Continued focus on making all components fully accessible
- **TypeScript Improvements**: Enhanced type safety and better developer experience
