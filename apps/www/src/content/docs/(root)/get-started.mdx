This guide provides the essentials for adding **audio/ui** components to your React application.

## Prerequisites

Our components are built with [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com). Before you begin, make sure you have a React project set up with Tailwind CSS.

## Adding Components

You can add components **automatically with the shadcn CLI** or **manually by copying the files**.

#### With the CLI

Each component page provides a command to add it to your project automatically. The CLI will create the necessary files and install any dependencies for you.

For example, to add the audio player:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @audio/player
```

#### Manually

1. **Find a component** on the [Components](/docs) or [Particles](/particles) pages.
2. **Copy the code** from the **Code** tab.
3. **Create a new file** in your project (e.g., `components/ui/audio/player.tsx`) and paste the code.
4. **Install any dependencies** listed on the component's page.
5. **Import and use** the component in your app.

### Step 3: Setup AudioProvider

First, wrap your app with `AudioProvider` at the root level:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx or _app.tsx
import { AudioProvider } from "@/components/ui/audio/provider"

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <AudioProvider tracks={initialTracks}>
          {children}
        </AudioProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### Step 4: Use the component

```tsx
import { AudioPlayer, AudioControlBar, AudioPlay } from "@/components/ui/audio/player"

export function MyAudioPlayer() {
  return (
    <AudioPlayer>
      <AudioControlBar>
        <AudioPlay />
      </AudioControlBar>
    </AudioPlayer>
  )
}
```

## Styling

Components are styled with a design token system defined by CSS variables and implemented with Tailwind CSS. The variables follow the same approach as shadcn/ui and are fully customizable.

For detailed information about styling, color tokens, and customization options, see the [shadcn/ui theming documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming).

## Working with LLMs

We structure the documentation to make the components **AI-friendly**, so language models can understand, reason about, and modify them. To support this, we include:

- A [llms.txt](/llms.txt) file that provides a map of the documentation and component structure for your AI agent.
- A **Copy Markdown** button on every page, so you can easily share content or feed it to your AI workflows.
