# `audio/ui`

**audio/ui** is a collection of accessible and composable components for building audio interfaces in your React apps. Built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), it's designed for you to copy, paste, and own.

We think shadcn/ui is the best foundation for modern web applications. We've taken its powerful, accessible components and given them a design system that's ready to go, right out of the box.

## Contributing

We're always looking for contributors to help improve our UI components. Whether it's a bug report, a new feature, or a documentation update, we appreciate your help.
